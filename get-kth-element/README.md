# find-smallest-kth-element

### create a function that takes an array of numbers
### the goal is to return the 'kth' lowest element of that array of numbers


### for example:
### take this list of nums -> [10,6,4,8,2]
### kth element -> 3
### the 3rd lowest element in the list of nums is 6, so I would return 6
### keep in mind, the given array will not be sorted, and it can also have duplicate numbers
